# Installing Workstation from minimal iso

Download the minimal iso from Alma's website and start the installation: [AlmaLinux OS 9.4 Minimal ISO]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9.4/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-9.4-x86_64-minimal.iso)

I first use GParted to remove any existing partitions from the harddisk I'm installing to. In the installer choices, I choose:
- install Workstation
- use automatic partitioning
- enter root password and allow root to login
- create user 'igor' with password and root-user rights

After installation, I'm greeted with the plain GNOME desktop.

Here we build the hierachy for the sidebar

This will show indented in the sidebar

## Paragarph 2 on the second page
